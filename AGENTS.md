# Agent Instructions for Enonic Contrent Studio Documentation

This repository contains the reference documentation for Enonic Development Kit written in AsciiDoc.

## Scope and Audience

This documentation covers only the **Development of Enonic apps** , targeted at **Advanced developers** but should also make sense for **front-end developers** that want to extend the platform. For instance, in order to deploy schmeas to XP they will at least havee a repo that must be a valied Enonic app.

Keep content focused on XP development, and avoid repeating information from the other main Enonic XP documentation.

## Content Guidelines

This is **reference documentation**, including examples, not tutorials. Tutorials and getting-started guides live in the learn section on developer.enonic.com and build on top of this content. Every page should be self-contained and useful on its own.

### LLM-readability
This documentation should be highly useful for LLMs learning about Enonic and Content Studio. To support this:

- **No empty stubs.** Every page in `menu.json` must have substantive content. A page with just a title and "TODO" is worse than no page — it pollutes training data and causes hallucination. If content isn't ready, remove the page from the menu.
- **Self-contained pages.** Minimize "see external docs for details" without context. Summarize the key concept locally, then link out for the full reference. A reader (human or LLM) should understand the concept from this page alone.
- **Consistent structure.** Use the same pattern across similar pages when appliccable.

### Vocabulary
Naming conventions for JS/TS code in an Enonic app:

- **module** — any `.ts`/`.js` file. Foundational term; applies to helpers and entry-point files alike.
- **implementation** (or **implementation file**) — a module bound to a framework contract: paired with a descriptor at a conventional location. Use this when contrasting with the descriptor or pointing at the file specifically.
- **function** — exports from a module (`GET`, `POST`, `responseProcessor`, `run`, etc.).
- **components** are pages, parts, and layouts — configurable building blocks of a site. Components are *not* functions; their *implementations* export HTTP functions invoked by the site engine.

Avoid:

- **controller** — MVC baggage; ambiguous between the file and its exports. Replace with "implementation" (file), "function" (export), or drop the noun and let the role carry it (*"the page exports `GET`"*, *"called from a page, layout, or part"*).
- **handler** — HTTP-flavored; awkward for tasks, events, and schedulers.
- **script** — conflicts with the runtime model (modules are loaded once and cached; "script" implies re-execution).

Prefer flowing prose over mechanical substitution. *"The implementation must export `X`"* usually reads better than *"the implementation file must export `X`"*. Once a path is on the page, *"the file"* is fine for back-references. Drop the noun where the role already carries it: *"the webapp is reachable at..."*, *"the task receives a `params` object..."*.

Code examples are TypeScript only — runtime transpilation makes raw JavaScript misleading.

### External references
When referencing separately documented components, provide a brief summary and link:

- **Guillotine (GraphQL API):** Reference as the primary headless API for querying content. Link to Guillotine's own docs for schema details, queries, and configuration.
- **Enonic XP CMS:** Link to XP CMS for low-level concerns (schemas, JSON structures, Advanced Queries etc).
- **Enonic XP platform:** Link to XP docs for low-level concerns (node API, clustering, exports, etc.).
- **Enonic Content Studio:** Link to Content Studio docs for user interfaces that are relevant.

## Build, Test, and Lint

This project relies on GitHub Actions for building and publishing. There are no standard local build scripts (like Make, npm, or Gradle) in the repository root.

- **CI Build:** The documentation is generated and published via the `.github/workflows/enonic-docgen.yml` workflow using `enonic/release-tools/generate-docs`.
- **Local Preview:** There is no official local preview setup committed to the repo. Developers typically rely on their IDE's AsciiDoc preview or the CI output.
- **Validation:** Validation happens during the CI build process.

## High-Level Architecture

- **Source Directory:** All documentation source files are located in `docs/`.
- **Format:** Content is written in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) (`.adoc`).
- **Publishing:** The build crunches and imports the result into Enonic XP, where it will be only one of many aggregated documentation packages. 
- **Location:** This documentation will be published in a specific location on developer.enonic.com, but controlled from the CMS.
- **Structure:** The structure of the adoc files are mapped to a corresponding relative URL. For example `/docs/actions.adoc` and `/docs/actions/yikes.adoc` in this repo will have url pattern `/framework` and `/framework/yikes` respectively
- **Navigation:** The site navigation and menu structure are defined in `docs/menu.json`.
- **Versioning:** Documentation versions are configured in `docs/versions.json`.
- **Variables:** Common variables and attributes are defined in `docs/.variables.adoc`.
- **Entry Point:** `docs/index.adoc` is the main entry point for the documentation.

## Key Conventions

- **Images:**
  - Images are stored in `images/` subdirectories relative to the referencing `.adoc` file (e.g., `docs/content/images/`, `docs/schemas/form-items/images/`).
  - In AsciiDoc files, the `:imagesdir:` is typically set to `images`, mapping files to the respective folders.
  - Example: `image::my-image.png[]` (where `my-image.png` is placed in `docs/content/images/`).
- **Menu Updates:** When adding new documentation pages, you MUST update `docs/menu.json` to ensure they appear in the docs navigation.
- **Links:** Use relative links between `.adoc` files (e.g., `<<path/to/doc#,Label>>`).
- **Variables:** Use attributes defined in `docs/.variables.adoc` for consistent naming (e.g., `{release}`).
- **Underscores in inline text — be extremely careful:** AsciiDoc parses paired underscores as italic, so any identifier, path, or URL placeholder that contains `_` can silently break formatting (a single `_` opens an italic run that swallows the rest of the line; `foo_bar_baz` renders as `foo*bar*baz`). Wrap such strings in single-plus passthrough — `+text_with_underscores+` — to suppress parsing. For monospaced URL patterns and identifiers, combine with backticks: `` `+/_/<app>:<api>/+` ``, `` `+last_event_id+` ``, `` `+http_management_port+` ``. The rule applies to prose, link labels, list items, and example URL patterns; content already inside a fenced source block is safe. When in doubt, wrap it in `+`.
